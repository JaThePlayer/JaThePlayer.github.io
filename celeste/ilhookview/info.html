    <h1>Celeste IL Hook Viewer</h1>

    This viewer receives data about all IL hooks applied on all methods, via launching the game, then opening a map with all mods from these gamebanana categories:
<pre>
helpers
other/misc
tools:other/misc</pre>
    Then, the <code>ildiff_all</code> command from Mapping Utils is used to automatically create the database.

    <h3>Warning</h3>
    Not all code mods are included in the database yet. Most notably, none of the code mods that ship with maps are included. This may change in the future.<br>
    This database may not include all hooks - if a mod lazily loads hooks as they're needed, it's likely that they won't be included.<br>
    <br>
    The database is updated <b>manually</b>.
